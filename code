const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // No logging is implemented, so any requests and errors are not recorded
  next();
});

app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  if (username === "admin" && password === "admin") {
    res.send("Welcome, admin!");
  } else {
    res.send("Invalid credentials");
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
This code has several issues:

There is no logging in place to track requests and errors, making it difficult to debug issues or identify potential security breaches.
The login route doesn't use any encryption or hashing, making it vulnerable to simple password cracking attacks
The login route does not validate the user's credentials against any external system, it only check for hardcoded username and password
The server does not have any mechanism to detect and prevent brute force attacks
To secure this code, you would need to add logging, validate user credentials against an external system, use encryption and hashing, and add security mechanisms to detect and prevent brute force attacks.
